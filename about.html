        <h3>Geetanjali Dhull</h3>
        <p>Head of Well Being Counsellors</p>
        <p>As a Head of Well-Being, Ms. Geetanjali brings years of experience in guiding teenagers toward better mental and emotional health. As an expert in adolescent psychology, she has worked closely with high school students, helping them navigate the growing challenges of stress, anxiety, and digital overload.

In today’s fast-paced world, excessive screen time has become a major concern, significantly impacting the mental well-being, emotional stability, and physical health of teenagers. Witnessing firsthand the rising cases of stress, anxiety, and sleep disturbances among students, Ms. Dhull felt a deep responsibility to address this issue. This website is her initiative to create awareness, provide guidance, and offer practical solutions to help students take control of their digital habits.</p>

    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
    <p>
      <p1><strong>The Beginning: A Silent Takeover</strong> <br></p1>
      It starts small—just a quick check of messages, a scroll through social media, a five-minute YouTube break. Before you know it, hours slip away, swallowed by endless notifications, bright screens, and algorithm-driven distractions. What once felt like entertainment and connection slowly turns into exhaustion, stress, and anxiety.
      For many high school students, this is no longer just a habit—it’s a way of life. <br>A world where screens dictate emotions, where likes and comments decide self-worth, and where the pressure to stay connected is overwhelming. The cost? Mental fatigue, loss of focus, declining health, and a growing sense of isolation.
      <br>
      <br>
      <p1><strong> The Realization: When Connection Becomes Disconnection</strong> <br></p1>
      As a Head of Well-Being Counsellor in an international school, <strong>Geetanjali Dhull</strong> has seen this firsthand. Students walk into her office, burdened with stress, struggling with anxiety, trapped in a cycle they can’t seem to break.<strong>"I just don’t have time anymore." "I can’t concentrate." "I don’t know why I feel so anxious."</strong><br>

      The culprit? <strong>Uncontrolled screen time.</strong><br>
      
      What was once a tool for learning and entertainment has become an invisible chain—<strong>limiting real-world experiences, damaging mental health, and disrupting the delicate balance of life.</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p1><strong> The Turning Point: A Mission for Change<br></strong></p1>
      Geetanjali knew this couldn’t continue. Students needed awareness, guidance, and a way to regain control. That’s why she created this platform—a space where teenagers, parents, and educators can understand the real impact of excessive screen time and learn how to break free.<br>
